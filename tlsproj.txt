1. All messages in this protocol have a type field sent in plaintext. If an attacker can alter packets being sent to and from the server, explain how it can launch a DoS attack on the server or client in a way that does not reveal it’s involvement.


2. Look at the function random int(). How are the ”random” numbers chosen? Can an attacker learn any information about our system or other random values if they know our method? Suggest a way that a man-in-the-middle might be able to use this to break our encryption. Tip: try printing random values as they are chosen during the handshake.

The random_int() function uses srand, a pseudo-random generator, with time(NULL) as the seed argument to chose random numbers. The output of time(NULL) is the time elapsed since the epoch (January 1 1970), which means we are actually calling srand on a small set of values that could be quessed by an attacker. 



3. We have talked about a downgrade attack in class before. Assuming that the server and client supported multiple cipher suites (some weaker than others), show how a downgrade attack might be possible on the Terribly Lacking Secu- rity handshake. Then suggest a method or adaptation to the handshake that would mitigate a downgrade attack.
