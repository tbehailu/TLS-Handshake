# CS 161 Project 1 - TLS Implementation

## Authors:

- Ivan Smirnov
- Tsion Behailu


## ToDo

7. Write up answers in writeup file.
8. Double-check client.c in a blank project folder to make sure it will work with autograder.
8. submit
9. Drink heavily in celebration!

## Random

- figure out why we need msg_type in receive_tls_message


## NOTES

1. Be sure that only client.c is modified, otherwise autograder will fail
2. Remember to check for errors and gracefully abort
